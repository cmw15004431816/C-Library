# C-Library
This is some fundamental data structure implemented in C language in header files.
I'm learning fundamental data structure(FDS), and these are my learning contents.
If you are also studying this currently, I hope this repository can provide you with some help.

All header files can be directly included and put into practical use.

If you want to use my header files, you can directly clone my repository using this line of code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmw15004431816/C-Library.git
```

The files are all about very easy structures.

When learning FDS, graph and hash-table are very important, but both the two structures are not included in my library.

If you want, you can add these missing files **`graph.h`** and **`hash-table.h`**.

Maybe there are still some mistakes in my code, so if you find any mistakes, feel free to make issues or make a pull request!ðŸ˜€
